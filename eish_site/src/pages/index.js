                By making a comprehensive assessment of how you are moving,
                we'll identify what is causing you pain or restricting your
                range of motion.
                <br />
                <br />
                Pain often comes from a biomechanical imbalance in the body:
                when segments of the joints and muscles are moving out of
                alignment, it can build tension in some muscles and the brain's
                neurological system.
                <br />
                <br />
                We can start with a therapeutic approach aimed at relief
                initially, while over time building functional exercises into
                your daily routine to help you move like new.

                For performance and sport specific training, we know that all
                sports require specific components of fitness: speed, power,
                agility and coordination. We'll test these components
                specifically to establish your baselines, then design a
                well-rounded program to net results in those specific areas,
                focusing on proper technique and a mindful approach to training.
