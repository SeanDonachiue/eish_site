Addressing muscle and joint pain/stiffness with techniques such as (click for more detail): 
Trigger point therapy: essentially, we are applying a localized pressure to the area that has increased tension. This will break up the adhesions in the muscle and fascia tissue by increasing circulation in the area. 
active release therapy: using trigger point therapy while getting the muscle to move in its natural plane of movement, this inhibits the mechanism that makes the muscle tense up,  
massage therapy: This will break up the adhesions in the muscle and fascia tissue by increasing circulation in the area when applying a steady pressure along the direction of the muscle fibres or transversely across them.  
assisted range of motion improvement: we can often improve range of motion by assisting the movement of the joint and applying a force that is opposite to the direction the muscle and joint are used to moving, this inhibits the muscleâ€™s natural protective mechanism to resist a stretch.  
muscle activation: Pain is often from biomechanical errors that our bodies gradually develop. While release of the overworked muscles is important, activation of the weak areas are equally as important to improve movement patterns and reduce further pain and stiffness. 
Cupping : This will break up the adhesions in the muscle and fascia tissue by increasing circulation in the area.
